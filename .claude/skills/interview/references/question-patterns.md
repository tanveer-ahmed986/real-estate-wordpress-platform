# Question Patterns

Techniques for discovering WHY (intent) and surfacing assumptions.

---

## Core Purpose

Questions serve two goals:

1. **Discover WHY** - Uncover intent behind surface requests
2. **Surface assumptions** - Expose and validate what AI is assuming

## Discovering WHY

### The WHY Questions

| Question                            | Discovers            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| "What problem does this solve?"     | Real need            |
| "Why is this needed now?"           | Urgency, context     |
| "What happens if we don't do this?" | Stakes, priority     |
| "Who benefits and how?"             | Users, value         |
| "What led to this request?"         | Background, triggers |
| "What does success look like?"      | Goals, criteria      |

### Laddering Technique

Dig progressively deeper into abstract requests:

```
Surface request
  → "Why do you need that?"
    → Reason
      → "Why is that important?"
        → Deeper reason
          → Root intent
```

**Example:**

```
"Add dark mode"
  → Why? → "Reduce eye strain"
    → Why an issue? → "Users work at night"
      → Why at night? → "Support team is 24/7"
        → Intent: Accessibility for shift workers
```

### 5 Whys Technique

Keep asking "why" until you hit root cause:

```
Request → Why? → Reason → Why? → Deeper → Why? → Root
```

**Example:**

```
"Add export to PDF"
  → Why? → "Need to share reports"
    → Why share? → "Stakeholders review weekly"
      → Why PDF? → "They print them"
        → Root: Stakeholders need printable weekly reports
```

### Intent vs Solution

Users often state solutions, not problems:

| User Says (Solution) | Ask to Find (Intent)                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| "Add a button for X" | "What should happen when users do X?"        |
| "Make it faster"     | "What's slow? What speed is acceptable?"     |
| "Use Redis"          | "What problem are you solving with caching?" |

## Surfacing Assumptions

### Why Assumptions Matter

AI always makes assumptions. Unvalidated assumptions → wrong output.

### The Assumption Declaration

After initial understanding, explicitly state assumptions:

```
"I'm assuming:
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]
- [Assumption 3]

Are these correct?"
```

### Assumption Categories

| Category        | Example Questions                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context**     | "Is this for web, mobile, or both?"               |
| **Users**       | "Who are the users? Technical or non-technical?"  |
| **Scale**       | "How many users/requests/items are we talking?"   |
| **Scope**       | "Should this include X, or is that separate?"     |
| **Integration** | "Does this need to work with existing system Y?"  |
| **Quality**     | "Any specific performance/security requirements?" |
| **Timeline**    | "Is there a deadline? Can this be phased?"        |

### Probing Hidden Assumptions

When user gives vague terms, probe:

| Vague Term | Probe                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "Fast"     | "What response time is acceptable?"           |
| "Scalable" | "What scale? 100 users? 1 million?"           |
| "Simple"   | "Simple for whom? What complexity is okay?"   |
| "Secure"   | "What threats? What compliance requirements?" |
| "Good UX"  | "What makes UX good for your users?"          |

## Question Types

### Open Questions

**Purpose**: Explore, gather context
**Pattern**: "What...", "How...", "Tell me about..."
**Use when**: Starting discovery, exploring WHY

### Closed Questions

**Purpose**: Confirm, validate
**Pattern**: "Is...", "Should...", "Do you want..."
**Use when**: Validating assumptions, confirming understanding

### Choice Questions

**Purpose**: Help decide between options
**Pattern**: "Would you prefer A, B, or C?"
**Use when**: Multiple valid approaches exist

### Probing Questions

**Purpose**: Dig deeper into vague answers
**Pattern**: "When you say X, what do you mean?"
**Use when**: Answer contains undefined terms

---

## Question Pacing

**Batch size**: 1-4 questions maximum

**Flow**:

1. Start with WHY questions (most important)
2. Surface assumptions based on answers
3. Probe vague terms
4. Confirm understanding

**Adapt depth**:

- Simple request → Quick check, proceed
- Complex/ambiguous → Full discovery
- High stakes → Thorough validation

## Signs You've Discovered Enough

### Surface Understanding (NOT ready)

- Know WHAT user asked for
- Don't know WHY they want it
- Have unvalidated assumptions

### Deep Understanding (READY)

- Know WHY (intent/problem)
- Know WHAT (agreed solution)
- Assumptions validated
- Scope boundaries clear
- User confirmed accuracy

**Test**: Could you explain to someone else WHY user wants this and WHAT you'll do, without guessing?
