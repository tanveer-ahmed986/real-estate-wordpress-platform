| **Total**            |        |        | **64.00** |

**Rating**: Adequate

### Honest Breakdown

**Structure & Anatomy (90/100)** - Excellent:

- 357 lines (well under 500)
- Complete frontmatter
- 2 reference files
- No extraneous files

**Content Quality (95/100)** - Excellent:

- Very concise
- Consistent imperative form
- Clear 6-step workflow
- Good appropriate freedom guidance

**User Interaction (50/100)** - Gaps:

- Step 1 mentions asking users questions during skill creation process
- But no structured "Required Clarifications" pattern
- No guidance on context awareness
- Missing "what if user doesn't answer"

**Documentation (30/100)** - Missing:

- No official documentation links
- No fetch guidance for unlisted scenarios
- References exist but no external sources
- No version awareness

**Domain Standards (40/100)** - Partial:

- Has output-patterns.md reference
- But no enforcement checklist
- No "Must Follow / Must Avoid" pattern
- No quality gates before delivery

**Technical Robustness (50/100)** - Partial:

- Scripts mentioned with testing requirement
- But no error handling guidance
- No security considerations
- Dependencies implicit

**Maintainability (85/100)** - Good:

- Modular references
- Clear organization
- But no update path guidance

### Improvement Recommendations for skill-creator

1. **High Priority**: Add official documentation links (if Anthropic has docs)
2. **High Priority**: Add structured clarification questions pattern
3. **Medium Priority**: Add "Must Follow / Must Avoid" enforcement pattern
4. **Medium Priority**: Add output checklist / quality gate
5. **Low Priority**: Add error handling guidance for scripts
6. **Low Priority**: Add update path / version awareness

**Note**: This is an honest assessment. Even official skills can have room for improvement to reach production-level standards.

## Calibration Notes

### Common Scoring Mistakes

1. **Over-scoring structure**: A skill with clean structure but no content shouldn't score high overall

2. **Under-scoring interaction**: Missing clarification patterns is a major gap for builder skills

3. **Ignoring domain specificity**: A widget skill without UX standards is incomplete; a data skill without validation patterns is incomplete

4. **Binary scoring**: Use the full 0-3 range, not just 0 or 3

### Skill Type Adjustments

**Builder Skills** (create artifacts):

- User Interaction weight: Higher importance
- Documentation weight: Higher importance
- Clarification questions: Essential

**Automation Skills** (run workflows):

- Technical Robustness: Higher importance
- Error handling: Critical
- User Interaction: Lower unless ambiguous inputs

**Guide Skills** (provide instructions):

- Content Quality: Higher importance
- Documentation: Higher importance
- User Interaction: Medium (depends on complexity)
