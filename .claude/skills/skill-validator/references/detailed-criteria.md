# Detailed Validation Criteria

Deep evaluation guidance for each criterion.

---

## 1. Structure & Anatomy

### 1.1 SKILL.md Exists

- **Score 3**: Present at root of skill directory
- **Score 0**: Missing = automatic fail

### 1.2 Line Count

- **Score 3**: <300 lines (lean and focused)
- **Score 2**: 300-500 lines (acceptable)
- **Score 1**: 500-800 lines (bloated, needs refactoring)
- **Score 0**: >800 lines (automatic fail - split into references)

**Why it matters**: Context window is a shared resource. Every line in SKILL.md competes with user's actual work.

### 1.3 Frontmatter Quality

**Score 3** - Complete, triggerable, proper format:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name # lowercase, hyphens, ≤64 chars, matches directory
description: | # ≤1024 chars, third-person style
  This skill creates X and validates Y.
  This skill should be used when users need to build widgets,
  generate reports, or process data.
---
```

**Score 2** - Present but format issues:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Creates X. Use when doing Y. # Not third-person
---
```

**Score 1** - Minimal:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: X skill
---
```

**Score 0**: Missing frontmatter

### 1.4 Name Constraints

**Score 3**: All constraints met

- Lowercase letters only
- Numbers allowed
- Hyphens for separation
- ≤64 characters
- Matches directory name exactly

**Score 2**: Minor violation (e.g., slightly over 64 chars)

**Score 1**: Multiple violations (e.g., uppercase, underscores)

**Score 0**: Name missing or completely invalid

### 1.5 Description Format

**Score 3** - [What] + [When] + Third-person:

```yaml
description: |
  Validates skills against production criteria.
  This skill should be used when reviewing, auditing, or
  improving skills to ensure quality standards.
```

**Score 2** - Has content but wrong style:

```yaml
description: |
  Validate skills against criteria.
  Use when reviewing skills.  # Not third-person
```

**Score 1** - Vague:

```yaml
description: Helps with skill stuff
```

**Score 0**: Missing or single word

### 1.6 No Extraneous Files

**Should NOT exist in skill directory**:

- README.md (SKILL.md IS the readme)
- CHANGELOG.md (version in frontmatter if needed)
- LICENSE (inherited from repo)
- package.json (unless skill runs scripts)
- .gitignore

**Exception**: `assets/`, `references/`, `scripts/` directories are expected.

### 1.7 Progressive Disclosure

**Score 3**:

- SKILL.md has overview + quick reference
- Complex patterns in `references/`
- Table of reference files with "when to read"

**Score 2**:

- Some content in references
- SKILL.md still has most detail

**Score 1**:

- References exist but poorly organized

**Score 0**:

- Everything in SKILL.md or no references

---

## 2. Content Quality

### 2.1 Conciseness

**Score 3** - Every sentence earns its place:

```markdown

1. Define input schema
2. Implement handler
3. Register tool
```

**Score 1** - Verbose:

```markdown
## Quick Start

In this section, we will walk through the steps needed to get started with creating your tool. First, you will need to define an input schema. This schema specifies what parameters your tool accepts...
```

### 2.2 Imperative Form

- Validate all inputs with Zod
- Return structured responses
- Handle errors gracefully
```

**Score 1**:

```markdown
- You should validate all inputs with Zod
- It would be good to return structured responses
- Try to handle errors gracefully
```

### 2.3 Appropriate Freedom

**Score 3** - Constraints where needed, flexibility elsewhere:

```markdown
## Required (No Exceptions)

These indicate runtime discovery instead of embedded expertise.

### 8.3 User-Only Questions

**Score 3** - Only asks about USER's context:

```markdown
| Ask                       | Don't Ask                  |
